### Gabriel Gallardo-Giozza repository
Hi! I'm Gabriel Gallardo-Giozza, a PhD graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, having Dr. Carlos Torres-Verdin and D. Nicolas Espinoza (%https://github.com/dnicolasespinoza%), who are co-authors 

I created this space to share scripts I developed during my MSc, PhD, and free (research) time.
Most scripts aims describes exercises and other useful resources mostly focused on borehole acoustic principles and applications towards petrophysics, geomechanics and seismic.
Most of the scripts are in Python or Matlab.
